1. We did not change our goals.
2. Our qualitative and quantiative results did not get close to reported results in the paper, as explained in detail in the notebook.
3. We plan to consider the following approaches:
	a. We emailed to the authors asking about specific things that are not included in the paper. We are waiting for the response.
	b. To localize the problem, we will try to use the standart loss for GAN instead of Geometric Block, while keeping the rest of the architecture.
